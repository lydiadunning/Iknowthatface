To handle tv series better:

Start with a show name
- See if it's possible to discover a full list of actors for a series. This would be preferable.
for each series, identify each episode that actor appeared in
for each episode, add any actor that isn't already on the results list to the results list.
Display the full list

Alternately, provide a truncated list followed by a set of options.
Know the episode's name or number? Show results for just one episode.
Know the season? Show results for just one season.
